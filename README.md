datasets and literature for the class 'mathematical aspects of machine learning'

Here are some datasets and literature for the project part of the class. Please
form a team of approximately 3 people. You should develop an algorithm that can
analyze at least one of the datasets in here. If you are doing supervised learning,
you must make predictions on the test data. If you are doing unsupervised learning,
report the structure you find. Project presentations are on the 17th and 19th of
July.

I do recommend that you look through the different datasets and resources available
first. Some datasets are significantly more challenging then others. Once you
have an idea what you might want to do, consider some toy datasets first.

Some toy datasets to get started are conveniently available from scikit-learn:
