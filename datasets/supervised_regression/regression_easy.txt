Some small datasets for regression problems.

Comments on the kaggle datasets: In general, for any kaggle dataset, there is a
'data' tab where a 'train.csv' and a 'test.csv' dataset can be downloaded. the
'train.csv' dataset contains labelled data and should be used to train the model.
The 'test.csv' dataset should be used for testing. If you want to see how well you
do, you can create an account for your team and submit your predictions for
'test.csv' to the website. You will then appear on the 'Leaderboard' tab.

Feel free to explore https://www.kaggle.com/competitions for more datasets. I do
recommend starting with the ones below though. Inform me if you want to use other
datasets.
