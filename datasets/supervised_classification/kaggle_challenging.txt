Here are a few links to some 'challenging' classification datasets from kaggle.com.
These datasets are larger then the 'easy' ones and likely more preprocessing.

In general, for any kaggle dataset, there is a
'data' tab where a 'train.csv' and a 'test.csv' dataset can be downloaded. the
'train.csv' dataset contains labelled data and should be used to train the model.
The 'test.csv' dataset should be used for testing. If you want to see how well you
do, you can create an account for your team and submit your predictions for
'test.csv' to the website. You will then appear on the 'Leaderboard' tab.

Feel free to explore https://www.kaggle.com/competitions for more datasets. I do
recommend starting with the ones below though. Inform me if you want to use other
datasets.

2) Understanding the amazon from space: This is a huge dataset of satellite images
  to be classified. You will have to think about subsampling and parsing the data
  if you want to work with this. Dimensionality reduction could also be useful here.
